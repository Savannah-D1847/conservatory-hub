        <h1><u>A Brief History of Marine Conservation</u></h1>
        <img class="centerimages" src="images/EnvironmentalismImage.jpg" alt="Protesters holding signs against climate change" title="Climate Justice=Social Justice protestor sign">
        <h4>In 1972, U.S. Congress passed a monumental set of laws which established much of what we call marine conservation today.</h4>
        <p>These laws include the <b><a class="colorwhite" href="https://coast.noaa.gov/czm/" target="_blank">Coastal Zone Management Act</a></b>, the <b><a class="colorwhite" href="https://www.justice.gov/enrd/water" target="_blank">Clean Water Act</a></b>,
        the <b><a class="colorwhite" href="https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/about/legislation/" target="_blank">Marine Sanctuaries Act</a></b>, and the <b><a class="colorwhite" href="https://www.marinemammalcenter.org/marine-mammal-protection-act" target="_blank">Mammal Protection Act</a></b>. 
        Together, these laws have served to protect oceans and coasts throughout the states.</p>
        <h4>The United Nations has also developed a treaty called <b><a href="https://www.cbd.int/" class="colornavy" target="_blank">Convention on Biological Diversity</a></b>.</h4>
        <p>This treaty is an agreement of wildlife conservation across world oceans. This treaty serves to protect ocean life
            as well as sustainably develop natural resources. </p>
        <h3>These laws and treaties are only a small part of the <a href="https://marine-conservation.org/us-ocean-governance/legislation/" target="_blank" class="colornavy">worldwide legislation</a> to protect
            marine habitats around the world. While over 70% of the earth is covered in water, very little of it is protected from harm.</h3>
        <h2 class="colorwhite">Conservation groups have established that we must ..."<i>protect at least 30% of the ocean to safeguard marine biodiversity and build ocean resilience.</i>"<sup>1</sup></h2>
        <h3>Important facts about marine conservation:</h3>
        <img class="centerimages" src="images/PlasticPollution.jpg" alt="Plastic bottles and waste on the seashore" title="Plastic waste covers beach, posing possible harm to marine life">
        <ul id="facts">
            <li>Every year, over 17 billion pounds of <a href="gallery.html#manatee" class="colorwhite">plastic</a> is dumped into the oceans.<sup>2</sup></li>
            <li>Large amounts of plastic waste can cause all of the oxygen in the water to be used up-creating a dead zone.<sup>2</sup></li>
            <li>It is important to keep the ocean healthy as it can help mitigate global warming.<sup>2</sup></li>
            <li>It has been predicted that by 2055, 90% of coral reefs around the world will have been damaged from <a href="gallery.html#bleaching" class="colorwhite">bleaching</a>.<sup>3</sup></li>
            <li>From 1970-2012, there has been almost a 50% population decline in marine groups around the world.<sup>4</sup></li>
        </ul>
