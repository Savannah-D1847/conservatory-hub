        <h1><u>Current Projects Around the World</u></h1>
        <h3>There are countless projects worldwide trying to help marine life. Here are several current projects:</h3>
        
        <h2><a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/projects/arcnet-protecting-marine-biodiversity-in-the-arctic" target="_blank" class="colornavy">ArcNet</a></h2>
        <img class="centerimages" src="images/Polar_Bear_-_Alaska.jpg" alt="picture of a polar bear" title="Polar Bear">
        <p>This project is based in the Arctic Ocean, and helps maintain biodiversity and ocean health. Animals in the Arctic have been greatly affected
            by global warming as the <a href="gallery.html#arctic" class="colorwhite">ice shrinks</a> and ocean warms. This project has focused on fishing and shipping industries in the area, working to reduce dangers caused by these industries to marine life.
            This project also has initiatives to make sure that a lot of their studies and policies are directed by Indigenous People to the area. This project is working to maintain a peaceful relationship between humans and animals in the Arctic.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/projects/the-global-mangrove-alliance-uniting-to-conserve-and-restore-valuable-coastal-forests" class="colornavy" target="_blank">Global Mangrove Alliance</a></h2>
        <img class="centerimages" src="images/mangrovetrees.jpg" alt="Mangrove trees in the water" title="Mangrove Trees">
        <p>This alliance aims to save <a href="gallery.html#mangroves" class="colorwhite">dying mangrove forests</a> around the world. Their current target for 2030 is to expand mangrove forests around the world by 20%.</p>
        <p><i>"We’ve lost 50% of the world’s mangroves just in the past half century, and if current trends continue, the remaining mangroves could be gone within the next 100 years."</i></p>
        <p>Saving these mangrove forests is another important part in stopping some of the impact of climate change. These forests are vital to many global communities, providing food and shelter. The safety of these environments must be protected.</p>

        <img class="centerimages" src="images/The_Coral_Reef_at_the_Andaman_Islands.jpg" alt="Vibrant Coral reef with fish" title="Coral reefs are at risk worldwide to heat bleaching">
        <p>The Coral Reef Alliance is a large group working towards the health and safety of coral reefs in Hawaii and the Caribbean.
            They specialize in research programs to study different ways to <a href="gallery.html#bleaching" class="colorwhite">mitigate damage</a> to reefs. Their research has been used to
            start real-life projects. They are working to reduce threats to the reefs and reduce carbon emissions as well.

        <h2><a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/international-affairs/marine-protected-area-antarcticas-ross-sea" class="colornavy" target="_blank">Ross Sea Protected Region</a></h2>
        <img class="centerimages" src="images/RossSea.jpg" alt="Large wall of ice at Ross Sea" title="Massive formation at Ross Sea">
        <p>Rather than an organization, this is the largest area protected for marine life in the world.
            This is a large part of the Ross Sea in Antarctica, and has been completely saved from industrial fishing in the area. This has made the area a safe haven for a massive variety
            of marine species.
