            <li>Reduce your personal climate impact</li>
            <p>Everyone can make little steps each day to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/nature/climatechange_action_home.htm" class="colorwhite" target="blank">reduce climate emissions</a>. First, reduce your single-use plastic
                waste as much as possible. Use glass containers whenever possible or re-use plastic. Massive amounts of plastics
                end up in oceans yearly, and are a massive risk to sea life. Second, reduce personal vehicle use whenever
                possible. Walking, biking, or taking public transport are all great ways to reduce emissions.
            </p>
            <li>Make sure your purchases are sustainable</li>
            <p>When shopping for seafood, make sure the food was caught with sustainable fishing practices. <a href="https://sentientmedia.org/commercial-fishing/" class="colorwhite" target="_blank">Industrial fishing</a>
                is harming large marine ecosystems, and purchasing from irreputable sources can be
                supporting these practices. Be sure to check if purchases containing any marine life byproducts are also sustainable.
            </p>
            <li>Educate others on marine conservation</li>
            <p>Making an impact is easier with others. Tell friends and family about best practices for marine conservation. Social media can also be used to educate others about important issues.</p>
            <li>Donate to current projects</li>
            <p>There is a long list of projects around the world which need donations. If you are able to give financially, that is one of the easiest ways to support the cause. Here are just a few:</p>
            <ul class="donatelist">
                <li><a href="https://oceana.org/">Oceana.org</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://oceanconservancy.org/">Oceanconservancy.org</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://coral.org/en/">Coral.org</a></li>

            </ul>
            <br>
            <li>Volunteer your time</li>
            <p>If there are marine conservation groups in your area, they are likely looking for volunteers. Giving of your time to support these causes 
                can be very rewarding! They are a great way to make an impact in your community and for the planet. The internet is a great resource to find
